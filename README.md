# Usability Test - Assignment 2

MyFitnessPal is a website and an app that allows users to track their daily calories and exercise routines in order to reach their fitness goal. It also allows users to find an online community to keep each other accountable along with healthy recipes and lifestyle blogging tips. Many people use the app for quick and easy access but not so much on the website. The rationale behind this usability test is to see how easy the website is to use because some issues that I found previously had a lot to do with recovery from error and being to navigate through the tabs easily. The purpose of the usability test aims to find solutions to improve the website from the perspective of users.  A pilot usability test was conducted in a room located near UCLA using one laptop using the Camtasia software to record the participant’s facial and verbal responses to using the website. First the user was read aloud the purpose of the study and went into the background questions of whether the user had used the website before. The participant stated that they never used the website before but they had used the app before and even acknowledged that the website is not as well organized as the app. Then, the user was given three different tasks to complete and to rate the ease of completing the tasks afterwards and how likely they were to using the site for these tasks on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. Then, the user was asked to answer a series of questions about the website on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree.  In the production satisfaction card at the end, the participant checked “boring,” “cheap,” and “old” about the website. Based on the pilot test, the participant found the website fairly easy to use but did not enjoy using it as the website seemed boring, cheap, and old to her. 

The pilot test video can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jxYNHZyAKt7O8DE4CQfA781S-hFMlElH/view?usp=sharing) and the google forms survey can be found [here](https://forms.gle/zMr8MCSfV8tP6eZdA). 


For the pilot test, I learned that a lot goes into the preparation aspect of the usability test and requires a lot of close attention to details. Even after going through my pre-test materials many times, I still ran into some problems with the form and video. I also learned that what I initially thought was going to be really easy for the participant turned out to be harder and vice versa. If this happened for one participant, I can see why usability tests are best with at least five participants. The process of the participant answering the questions went well as she didn’t have any questions throughout the survey. The participant had used the app before and even acknowledged the poor design of the website compared to the app. The only part that did not go so well was when the second task, the question was not set up for checkboxes but was set up for multiple choice answers which was an error on my part. However, it did not affect the usability test very much. In the future, I want to improve my UT by providing slightly harder tasks and checking the google forms survey even more thoroughly.
