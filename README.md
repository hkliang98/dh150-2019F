# Heuristic Evaluation

-Description/overall evaluation
The core function of the website and app, myfitnesspal, is to be used as a tool to help users track their caloric intake and exercise. When used daily, the app makes charts of daily and weekly progress so that users can visualize what has progressed over time. There are other tabs that suggest similar applications, a community forum, and a blog that shares recipes and healthy lifestyle tips. Overall, it is a good tool in that it is fairly easy to use once users have used it frequently over a period of time and has a plethora of information all in one site. It gets easier to use as users log more and more in. However, it could be improved if there were more options for food and exercise entries that are readily available for users that are completely new to calorie and exercise tracking. For the most part, the design and layout of the site is pretty intuitive and users can guess what each tab opens but manually entering entries has the potential to waste a lot of time. Next, I would implement a status system update for food and exercise entries because it can be hard to keep track without having to look at the main page. Finally, I would add more visuals or to some of the tabs because it looks a bit monochromatic with just blue and white as the site colors and could lose the attention of other users. 


-Visibility of system use 
In the food diary tab, users are able to log what they ate for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even snacks. The diary tracks the calories and macronutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, and protein. When you track breakfast, at the bottom, it tells the user how many calories and macronutrients they have left for the day to stay on track with their goals. (1) 
The diary is very useful for users who want to track their calories but there is a lack of visible status in the process of adding the food items since you don’t know if it has been logged until you look at the log. Users may not be aware whether or not their food entry has been entered so it could lead to an error in entries or repeating. (2) 
At the bottom of the page of the food diary, there is a section to track water consumption and there is an image of cup that gets filled up when the user has drank water. (1) 

-Match between system and the real world 
The website is good in speaking in a language that users can understand. The first image users see on the website is “Fitness starts with what you eat” and there is a button below “Start for free” to invite users to track what they eat. As you scroll under, there is a search bar inviting users to look up any food item to see the calorie count and macronutrients to let new users try it out first before they sign up. As you scroll down the website more, there is a button that says “Start your journey today” inviting users to begin a healthy lifestyle using the site. It is simple yet inviting. (1) 

-User control and freedom 
If you delete an entry from food diary on accident, you cannot undo very quickly and would have to input manually once again. (2)
If the user wants to modify how many servings you ate, the user would have a difficult time looking for an “edit” button as that is what is most intuitive. But the way to do it is to click the food item. This lacks intuition and may be difficult for users who aren’t used to this site to use. The same goes for editing number and sets for exercise. The user does not click on the number to edit but clicks on the exercise which doesn’t seem as intuitive. There is a no underline or variation in font to indicate that it is how the user should edit after making an entry. (3) 

-Consistency and standards 
Between the tabs of “Food” and “Exercise” there is a lack of consistency of the sub-tabs. Both have some sort of diary, database, my “foods” or “exercises”, and settings. However, the “Food” tab also has “My Meals” and “Recipes” while there is not one for the “Exercise” tab. There could be tabs under “Exercise” called “My Workouts” because users could be doing the same routine when they’re working out like they would cook the same recipes. (2) 
In the “Exercise Diary” it is also inconsistent in recording calories burned because it only records calories burned for cardiovascular exercises but not for strength training. If users strength train more than they perform cardiovascular exercises, this could lead to inconsistency in the amount of calories burned and could result in users not eating calories to reach their caloric goal. It also makes the assumption that strength training doesn’t burn as many calories as cardiovascular training. (3) 

-Error prevention 
Website does not correct users if they spell food items wrong so it will list items that spell it wrong as well and could lead to future problems. (2)  
There is no undo button after entering food diary and exercise diary (2) 
The closest thing is the button called “Make Additional Entries” and would allow users to add more if they forgot something (1) 

-Recognition rather than recall 
No recognition for exercises so the user needs to manually input so it might be difficult when users do not know what the exercises they have been doing is called (3) 
Many beginner users follow exercise guides so it is possible they do not know what the exercise is called (2) 
Need to know the specific name of exercise in order to log it in exercise log and lack of or extra space will make it so that the exercise will not show up (2) 
Ex. “Lat pull down” did not show up but “Lat pulldown” did and did not show the red squiggly line under words that are misspelled to show that it is spelled incorrectly 

-Flexibility and efficiency of use 
In both the “Food” and “Exercise” tab, there is an option next to “Add Food” or “Add Exercise” called “Quick Tools.” Once the user clicks “Quick Tools”, it gives the option to “Copy yesterday,” “Copy from date,” or “Copy to date” so that users can easily and quickly copy their meal or exercises to another day if they ate or did the same thing. This makes it more efficient so that users do not have to manually input the same thing again. (1) 

-Aesthetic and minimalist design 
The website design is satisfactory in that it is easy to navigate and the tabs are all self-explanatory by first glance. There are only pictures on the homepage to attract users when they initially visit the site. However, the community page would look better if there were some visuals so that it looks like a community page. The community page does not look as open and requires going through multiple tabs to see other users’ experience with using the site. (1) 

-Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 
If the user makes an error in entering a food or exercise entry, it does not load an error message so the user will not know. It just says nothing can be found. This can be misleading, especially if it’s due to a spelling error so it can lead to errors in the overall daily entry. (2) 

-Help and documentation 
There is a help option in the top right corner next to settings. Once the user clicks on it, there are many sections with many articles in each for “Announcements and Terms of Use,” “Using the App,” “My Fitness Premium,” “Social Features,” “App Gallery,” “Nutrition 101,” and “Troubleshooting.” (1) 
Once the user clicks on the help button, there is another tab on the bottom right of the screen “Get Help” where the user can ask a question and it will generate a variety of answers that could answer the question. If the answer is not what the user wanted, they have to scroll to the bottom to click “Contact Support.” This “Get Help” section is a bit misleading because it appears that it would lead to a quick customer service answer but the user would have to go through another step in order to hopefully get their questions answered.
